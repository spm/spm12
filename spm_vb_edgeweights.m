% Compute edge set and edge weights of a graph
% FORMAT [edges,weights]= spm_vb_edgeweights(vxyz,img)
% 
% vxyz     list of neighbouring voxels (see spm_vb_neighbors)
% img      image defined on the node set, e.g. wk_ols. The edge weights 
%          are uniform if this is not given, otherwise they are a function
%          of the distance in physical space and that between the image
%          at neighboring nodes

% edges    [Ne x 2] list of neighboring voxel indices
% weights  [Ne x 1] list of edge weights 
% Ne       number of edges (cardinality of edges set)
% N        number of nodes (cardinality of node set)
