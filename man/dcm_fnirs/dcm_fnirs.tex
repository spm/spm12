Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a noninvasive method for monitoring hemodynamic changes in the brain via measurements of optical absorption changes \cite{jobsis1977noninvasive}. As neuronal process requires extra delivery of oxygen, this hemodynamic change provides a marker of underlying neuronal activity. \\

As compared to fMRI, fNIRS provides a more direct measure of changes in oxygenated, deoxygenated, and total hemoglobin (HbO, HbR, and HbT) with high temporal resolution. However, due to complex relationships between neurodynamic and hemodynamic processes, functional connectivity often differs with the type of hemodynamic changes (e.g., HbO and HbR), while underlying interactions between neuronal populations do not vary. This highlights the importance of estimating causal influences among neuronal populations, referring to a biophysical model of how neuronal activity is transformed into fNIRS measurements. \\

DCM for fNIRS allows for making inference about changes in directed connectivity at the neuronal level from the measurement of optical density changes \cite{tak2015dynamic}. DCM is a framework for fitting differential equation models of neuronal activity to brain imaging data using Bayesian inference \cite{dcm, karl_vb_laplace, dcm_families}. Because the Bayesian estimation is the same as the one used for DCMs for other imaging modalities \cite{karl_vb_laplace, dcm_families}, the main differences are a generative model describing how observed fNIRS data are caused by the interactions among hidden neuronal states. \\

In particular, the neurodynamic and hemodynamic models used for DCM-fMRI analysis \cite{dcm} are extended to additionally include the following components:
\begin{itemize} 
\item In the hemodynamic model, \emph{the rate of HbT changes} $\dot{p}_j$, \cite{cui10}, is modeled as:
\begin{eqnarray} 
\tau_j \dot{p}_j  =  \left(f_{j,in} - f_{j,out}\right)\frac{p_j}{v_j},
\end{eqnarray}
where $j$ denotes cortical source region, $f_{j,in}$ is inflow, $f_{j,out}$ is outflow, $v_j$ is blood volume, and $\tau_j$ is the transit time. 

\item \emph{An optics model} relates the hemodynamic sources to measurements of optical density changes \cite{delpy1988estimation, arridge1999optical}. Optical density changes at channel $i$ and wavelength $\lambda$, $y_i(\lambda)$, are described as a linear combination of light absorption changes due to hemoglobin oxygenation: 
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:optics} 
y_i (\lambda) = \frac{1}{\omega_{i,H}} \sum_{i=1}^{N} S_{i,j}(\lambda)\epsilon_H(\lambda) \Delta H_{j,c} +  \frac{1}{\omega_{i,Q}} \sum_{i=1}^{N} S_{i,j}(\lambda)\epsilon_Q(\lambda) \Delta Q_{j,c}
\end{eqnarray} 
where $\Delta H_{j,c}$ and $\Delta Q_{j,c}$ are the HbO and HbR changes in the cortical source region $j$; $S(\lambda)$ is the sensitivity matrix at wavelength $\lambda$; $\epsilon_H$ and $\epsilon_Q$ are the extinction coefficients for HbO and HbR; $\omega = \frac{\mathrm{cortical}}{\mathrm{cortical} + \mathrm{pial}}$ is a factor for correcting the effect of pial vein oxygenation changes on fNIRS measurements  \cite{gagnon2012quantification}. 

\item \emph{Spatially extended hemodynamic sources}. In the optics model (Eq.~\ref{eq:optics}), each hemodynamic signal is modelled as a point source which produces a hemodynamic response at a single specified anatomical location. However, the hemodynamic response can be spatially extended. Hemodynamic activity at a source location is then specified by convolving the temporal response with a Gaussian spatial kernel.

\end{itemize} 

\section{Example: Motor Execution and Imagery Data} 
This section presents an illustrative DCM analysis using fNIRS data acquired during the motor execution and motor imagery tasks. This data was collected by Agnieszka Kempny and Alex Leff in Royal Hospital for Neuro-disability, and is available from the SPM website\footnote{\url{http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/data/fnirs/}}.

\subsection*{Experimental protocol}
\begin{itemize}
\item In the first session, the subject was instructed to squeeze and release a ball with her right hand during task blocks. In the second session, the subjected was instructed to perform kinesthetic imagery of the same hand movement, but without moving the hand. 
\item For both sessions, there were 5 second blocks of tasks where the cue was presented with an auditory beep, interspersed with 25 second rest blocks. 
\item A previous study found consistent activation in the supplementary motor area (SMA) and premotor cortex during motor execution and imagery, and reduced activation in primary motor cortex (M1) during motor imagery \cite{hanakawa2003functional}. Moreover, a recent study has revealed, using DCM for fMRI \cite{kasess2008suppressive}, that coupling between SMA and M1 may serve to attenuate the activation of M1 during motor imagery. 
\item In this manual, using DCM-fNIRS, we investigate (i) how the motor imagery condition affects the directed connections between SMA and M1, and (ii) how these interactions are associated with the regional activity in M1 and SMA during motor execution and imagery.
\end{itemize}

\section{SPM Analysis}
Prior to DCM analysis, brain regions whose dynamics are driven by experimental conditions are identified using a standard SPM analysis\footnote{The first-level fNIRS analysis. including preprocessing, artefact removal, general linear modelling, spatial registration were all implemented using the SPM for fNIRS toolbox. This is available from \url{https://www.nitrc.org/projects/spm_fnirs/.} See the toolbox manual for more details.}. Using motor execution and imagery data, we can find that SMA is significantly activated during both motor execution and motor imagery, whereas M1 is only activated during motor execution. The most significantly activated voxels within SMA and M1 are then selected as the source positions for DCM analysis: The MNI coordinates are: SMA, $[51, 4, 55]$; and M1, $[44, 16, 65]$.

\section{Specifying and Estimating the DCM}
Now we will generate a connectivity model of how observed fNIRS data are caused by interactions among hidden neuronal states. Specifically, we will determine (i) which regions receive driving input, (ii) which regions are connected in the absence of experimental input, and (iii) which connections are modulated by input. In this example, we will generate the best model (selected using Bayesian model comparison) in which task input could affect regional activity in both M1 and SMA, and motor imagery modulates both extrinsic and intrinsic connections.
