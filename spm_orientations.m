function spm_orientations(P)
% Show the orientations that SPM assumes that the data are
% stored in.  Standard Analyze format axial images will
% normally be reported as 'RPI   Left-handed'.  Some people
% will represent their axial images as Right-handed.
% 'RPI' means that the fastest changing direction (i.e.
% the first element of the voxel coordinate) in the
% file is Right->left, the middle (second element of
% voxel coordinate) is Posterior->anterior and the
% slowest (third element - indicating slice number) is
% Inferior->superior.
%
% One thing to watch out for is the image orientation. The
% proper Analyze format uses a left-handed coordinate system,
% whereas Talairach uses a right-handed one. In SPM99, images
% were flipped at the spatial normalisation stage (from one
% coordinate system to the other). In SPM2, a different
% approach is used, so that either a left- or right-handed
% coordinate system is used throughout. The SPM2 program is
% told about the handedness that the images are stored with by
% the spm_flip_analyze_images.m function and the
% defaults.analyze.flip parameter that is specified in the
% spm_defaults.m file. These files are intended to be
% customised for each site. If you previously used SPM99 and
% your images were flipped during spatial normalisation, then
% set defaults.analyze.flip=1. If no flipping took place, then
% set defaults.analyze.flip=0.
%
% Check that when using the Display facility (possibly after
% specifying some rigid-body rotations) that:
%
%     * The top-left image is coronal with the top (superior)
%       of the head displayed at the top and the left shown on
%       the left. This is as if the subject is viewed from
%       behind.
%
%     * The bottom-left image is axial with the front
%       (anterior) of the head at the top and the left shown
%       on the left. This is as if the subject is viewed from
%       above.
%
%     * The top-right image is sagittal with the front
%       (anterior) of the head at the left and the top of the
%       head shown at the top. This is as if the subject is
%       viewed from the left.
