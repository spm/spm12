function D = spm_mldivide(A, B)
% Regularised variant of mldivide(A, B) or A \ B, similar to spm_inv(A) * B
% FORMAT D = spm_mldivide(A, B)
%
% D = inv(A) * B, or if A is near singular D = inv(A + TOL*eye(size(A)) * B
% 
% where TOL is adaptively increased if necessary.
%
% This function should be preferable to spm_inv(A) * B if A is large and
% sparse or if B has few columns, since the inverse need not be explicitly
% computed (the linear system can be solved with the backslash operator).

% A problem with this (and with original spm_inv) is that negative definite
% matrices (or those with mixed positive and negative eigenvalues) will not
% be sensibly regularised by adding a scaled identity. However, it is both
% expensive to compute the eigenvalues and also difficult to find a general
% strategy to handle a mixed-sign set of eigenvalues.

% Stop warning being displayed, but clear lastwarn so can observe occurrence
